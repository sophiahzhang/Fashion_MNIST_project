Shirt Classification

*In this project some image data of tee-shirts (output label 1) and other types of shirts (output label 0) are taken from the Fashion MNIST dataset. 
*The input and output data for a training set and for a test set have been preprocessed and prepared. 
*Different feature transformations (transforming the input features) and parameters like regularization penalty, etc. are tested and given to the classifier.
*The goal is to build a logistic regression classifier that can distinguish tee shirts from other clothing given an image.
